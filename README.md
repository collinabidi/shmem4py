This is a Python wrapper for the C-based SHMEM library that is part of the OpenMPI 4.0.3 package.

It is authored by [Collin Abidi](https://github.com/collinabidi) as a part of the **High-Performance Computing** 
group at [**NSF SHREC**](https://nsf-shrec.org/).

[**OpenSHMEM**](http://www.openshmem.org/site/) allows for communication that is non-blocking on the host and target, 
allowing for novel pipeline-partitioning data movement schemes.
