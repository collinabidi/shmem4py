This is a Python wrapper for the C-based SHMEM library that is part of the OpenMPI 4.0.3 package.

It is authored by [Collin Abidi](https://github.com/collinabidi) as a part of the **High-Performance Computing** 
group at [**NSF SHREC**](https://nsf-shrec.org/).

The basic test script, *shmemtest.py*, uses the **ctypes** library to access functions from a **.so** file.
